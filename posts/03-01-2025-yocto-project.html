            <h2>Deploying first Linux distro with Yocto</h2>
            <p class="post-meta">Published on January 9, 2025</p>

            <section class="post-content">
                <h3>Yocto</h3>
                <p>SBCs are an excellent playground for learning and utilizing embedded Linux. The BBG includes a built-in Debian-based OS variant, but you are free to deploy an operating system of your choice (but it must support your SBC's CPU!).</p>
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h3>Excellent Embedded Linux Tutorial</h3>
                    <p>There is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vsu67uMcko&list=PLEBQazB0HUyTpoJoZecRK6PpDG31Y7RPB">fantastic tutorial</a> covering SBCs and embedded linux by Shawn Hymel on YouTube. I heavily encourage you to watch it before continuing because I will not explain all the concepts covered in that tutorial.</p>
                </div>

                <p>Unlike pre-built distributions like Ubuntu or Debian, Yocto enables developers to build an operating system from the ground up, including only the components required for the target application. This is especially important in embedded systems where storage, performance, and power efficiency are critical.</p>
                <h3>Poky</h3>
                <p>Yocto provides also something called "Poky". It serves as a central framework to manage and execute the tasks required to build a custom Linux-based operating system. Essentially, it's a set of tools, metadata, and recipes bundled together to make building Linux with Yocto easier.</p>
                <p>The building process should happen not on the SBC itself but on a more powerful host machine (like your PC). Also Yocto is primarily designed for working from Linux so if you have Windows it will be trickier to get it to work.</p>
                <h3>Setting up for first Linux build</h3>
                <p>Various SBCs require custom "layers" apart from Poky itself in order to be compatible with Yocto. BBG however is supported by default! Nevertheless we must do some basic setup before proceeding with our first custom Linux deployment.</p>
                <h3>Necessary Hardware</h3>
                <p>I wasted an awful lot of time troubleshooting during my first Linux deployment to the BBG. Later it turned out that everything worked but I just didn't see the output because I've been using a wrong wire. Make sure you have a cable like the FTDI cable - more on it <a href="https://docs.beagleboard.org/accessories/cables.html#standard-ftdi-cable">here</a> (notice they mention also other compatible cables).</p>
                <div class="image-frame-wrapper">
                    <figure class="image-frame">
                        <div class="image-group">

                        </div>
                        <figcaption>
                            Serial debug wire connection on BBG - if you're using BeagleBone Black refer to <a href="https://www.dummies.com/article/technology/computers/hardware/beaglebone/how-to-connect-the-beaglebone-black-via-serial-over-usb-144981/">this example</a> instead.

                </div>  
                <p>You will also need a micro SD card to boot the OS on BBG - make sure you have a way to connect the SD card to your host machine too.</p>
                <h3>Installing necessary tools</h3>
                <p>We will follow some steps from the <a href="https://docs.Yoctoproject.org/brief-Yoctoprojectqs/index.html">official tutorial</a>. Notice that Yocto lists officially supported Linux distros <a href="https://docs.Yoctoproject.org/ref-manual/system-requirements.html#supported-linux-distributions">here</a>, but it doesn't mean that other distros definitely won't work</p>
                <ol class="custom-steps">
                    <li><h4>Install dependencies</h4>
                        <div class="code-block shell-code-block">
                            sudo apt install build-essential chrpath cpio debianutils diffstat file gawk gcc git iputils-ping libacl1 liblz4-tool locales python3 python3-git python3-jinja2 python3-pexpect python3-pip python3-subunit socat texinfo unzip wget xz-utils zstd
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>Clone Poky repo</h4>
                        <div class="code-block shell-code-block">
                            git clone git://git.Yoctoproject.org/Poky
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>Select Poky version</h4>
                        <p>In Poky repo (you can check on github) there are many branches - many of them correspond to Yocto releases you can see <a href="https://wiki.Yoctoproject.org/wiki/Releases">here</a>. Checkout to the branch named with the release you choose (can be the latest or the latest LTS, for some cases you will need older releases) - you'll need to pull the branch from the remote.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>Board Support Package</h4>
                        <p>Most boards require you to download BSP repo to complement the Poky files, but BBG is supported by default so we don't have to do anything.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>Initialize bitbake</h4>
                        <p>To activate Poky's command "bitbake" you need to run source [path-to-Poky-repo]/oe-init-build-env [build-directory-name]. It will also create directory for building your Linux.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>Prepare your build directory</h4>
                        <p>Because Poky supports a few boards (not only BBG) by default, you'll need to point out the one you use. In order to do so navigate to your newly created directory, go to conf, open local.conf. Now you need to uncomment MACHINE ?= "beaglebone-Yocto".</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>Ensure you have software for reading serial data</h4>
                        <p>In order to build minimal linux you can run: bitbake core-image-minimal from your build directory. The core-image-minimal roughly represents the bare minimum to build a slim Linux distro.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Build your Linux! üêß</h3>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h3>The 1st build will take a lot of time AND SPACE!</h3>
                    <p>Building Linux with Yocto takes enormous amount of storage - a few dozens or even triple-digit numbers of GBs. It's due to (among other things) caching of the build process. Basically it's trading build time for storage space. This doesn't refer to the very first build though. Make sure you have a lot of space free - I used to have situations where build was crashing at 99% because I was running out of space and I needed to rebuild the whole thing.</p>
                    <p>The first build will take multiple hours to complete so brace yourself for a little bit of waiting ü§£üòÇ</p>
                </div>
                <p>In my case, build process lasted more than an hour and a half and took over 50GB of storage.</p>
                <div class="image-frame-wrapper">
                    <figure class="image-frame">

                        <figcaption>
                            Summary of a build - I used "Scarthgap" release and worked from Majaro 24.2.1 (notice that Manjaro is not listed as officialy supported distro but it succeeded in my case)
                        </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <h3>Deployment üöÄ</h3>
                <p>Some boards require some complicated procedures of partitioning SD card for booting. In case of BBG everything is simple. In your build directory navigate to tmp/deploy/images/beaglebone-Yocto and find .wic file (if there are multiple files you should pick the biggest one).</p>
                <p>Now you'll need to erase everything from your SD card - be carfeul not to confuse it with your real diks because the operation is NOT reversible!</p>
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h3>Ensure you select the right device</h3>
                    <p>You can use lsblk command to list the available devices. Double check you selected the right one so that you don't erase your important data.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="code-block shell-code-block">
                    sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/your-sd-card-device bs=1M status=progress
                </div>
                <p>Once you did it you can write the .wic file into the SD card (again be careful to select correct device in of!)</p>
                <div class="code-block shell-code-block">
                    sudo dd if=path/to/file.wic of=/dev/your-sd-card-device bs=1M status=progress
                </div>
                <p>The process might take a few or a few dones of minutes to complete (depends on your SD card size). Once it's done put your SD card into the slot in BBG. Personally, I had issues with my slot often facing mechanical issues which led to failure of SD card detection. Manually bending the troublesome pins in the SD slot has been solving my issues every single time.</p>
                <p>Pesky thing I encounter on my board is in order to trigger the boot I have to first connect only the debug serial wire and connect via picocom (or other serial communication client) and only then connect the main cable to the BBG - otherwise I have issues detecting the device on my host machine</p>
                <p>The board has its internal flash memory with default OS installed. If it loads instead of your OS, then you'll need to press boot button (marked as "User" on the board) while connecting the BBG to power (via cable). This will change the boot policy.</p>

                        <figcaption>
                            The boot button is labeled as "User" ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
                        </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <ol class="custom-steps">
                    <li><h4>Insert microSD card to the slot in BBG</h4></li>
                    <li><h4>Connect degug wire to the host machine and BBG</h4></li>
                    <li><h4>Connect to serial data on your host</h4>
                        With picocom you can run picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyUSB0 (or whatever serial port your BBG is registered at)
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>Connect main wire to the BBG</h4>
                        Connect BBG micro USB slot to for example PC's USB port. It's possible that you will need to press boot button on BBG while connecting if the wrong (default) system loads instead of our custom build.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>If everything goes right you should be able to see your OS on the serial output (via picocom for instance) and interact with it. The system will ask you for password (the default is simply "root").</p>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>Surely there's a little mess with building Linux (on BBG but it's still much easier than on some other boards üòÇ), but we successfully laid down foundations for doing some more specific tasks in order to unleash the power of Linux on the SBC.</p>
